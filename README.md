# Exploring-backend-connectivity
In this assignment, I learned how to communicate with a backend server. According to the data from the server, a table is created.
When a line is deleted, the data is also deleted on the server. When a new row is added, the data is sent to the server, and if 
everything is successful, the table is redrawn at the client.
